2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller/RD_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller/RD_reg_i_2/O, cell controller/RD_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller/WR_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller/WR_reg_i_2/O, cell controller/WR_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/full_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/status_reg_i_1__0/O, cell controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/status_reg_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller/dataTxFifo/pRead_counter/empty_reg_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller/dataTxFifo/pRead_counter/status_reg_i_1/O, cell controller/dataTxFifo/pRead_counter/status_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller/recvData_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller/recvData_reg_i_2/O, cell controller/recvData_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
