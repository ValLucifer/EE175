2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance controller/dataTxFifo/memory_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/OE_reg_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/RD_reg_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#3 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/WR_reg_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#4 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/status_reg_i_1__0 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#5 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/dataTxFifo/pRead_counter/status_reg_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#6 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/recvData_reg_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#7 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/sendData_reg_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of -6.168 ns between controller/state_reg[0]/Q (clocked by controller/state[0]) and controller/recvData_reg/D (clocked by controller/state[2]) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -1.398 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#2 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 10.523 ns between controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/graycount_reg[6]/Q (clocked by controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/pNextToWrite[6]) and controller/dataRxFifo/status_reg/D (clocked by controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/pNextToWrite[5]) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -5.419 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#3 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 5.647 ns between controller/dataTxFifo/pRead_counter/graycount_reg[6]/Q (clocked by controller/dataTxFifo/pRead_counter/pNextToRead[6]) and controller/dataTxFifo/status_reg/D (clocked by controller/dataTxFifo/pRead_counter/pNextToRead[5]) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -3.930 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -11.646 ns between controller/OE_reg/G (clocked by controller/state[1]) and ftdi_oe (clocked by ftdi_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.552 ns between controller/WR_reg/G (clocked by controller/state[1]) and ftdi_wr (clocked by ftdi_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.350 ns between controller/dataTxFifo/status_reg/G (clocked by controller/dataTxFifo/pRead_counter/pNextToRead[5]) and controller/dataTxFifo/empty_reg/D (clocked by ftdi_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.806 ns between controller/RD_reg/G (clocked by controller/state[1]) and ftdi_rd (clocked by ftdi_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on ftdi_oe relative to clock(s) ftdi_clk
Related violations: <none>
