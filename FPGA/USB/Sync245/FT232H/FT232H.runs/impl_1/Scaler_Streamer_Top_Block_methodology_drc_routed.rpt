TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/RD_reg_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/WR_reg_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#3 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/status_reg_i_1__0 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources.

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation on inter-clock path  
There is a large inter-clock skew of 9.703 ns between controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/graycount_reg[6]/Q (clocked by controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/pNextToWrite[6]) and controller/dataRxFifo/status_reg/D (clocked by controller/dataRxFifo/pWrite_counter/pNextToWrite[5]) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -3.466 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.704 ns between controller/OE_reg/D (clocked by controller/state[1]) and ftdi_oe (clocked by ftdi_clk).
